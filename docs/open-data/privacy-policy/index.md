Confidentiality and data protection
{: .govuk-heading-m}

The Department for Transport (DfT) is providing a system to facilitate street works planning and collaboration via the Plan and Manager Roadworks system, and a subset of this data will be published as an open data service. This service and the processing of personal data that it entails is necessary for the department to effectively manage and maintain the open data API (Application Programming Interface).
{: .govuk-body}

As part of this service we’re asking for your name and email address. You are required to provide us with this information as part of the terms of use for the Plan and Manage Roadworks open data service, and the processing of this information is necessary for the Department to undertake a public task. DfT will, under data protection legislation, be a joint data controller for this information alongside the organisation that provided the data. The responsibilities of the DfT and external organisations have been defined in the Street Manager’s Memorandum of Understanding, and it remains the responsibility of data providers to respond to any Freedom of Information requests, Individual Rights Requests or otherwise that apply to the data you have received.
{: .govuk-body}

The personal data you provide will only be used to contact you if necessary and we will not share your contact details with anyone.

DfT’s privacy policy has more information about your rights in relation to your personal data, how to complain and how to contact the Data Protection Officer. You can view it at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/about/personal-information-charter"> https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/about/personal-information-charter</a>.

Your information will be kept securely in a DfT system stored in the United Kingdom, and destroyed when the account is no longer in use.
