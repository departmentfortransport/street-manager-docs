## Where to get information about outages
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<p class="govuk-body">
Outages will be announced on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://streetmanager.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1">Service desk</a>. You can also ask for information in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dftstreetmanager.slack.com/">DfT Street Manager Slack</a>.
</p>

## What to do during an outage
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<p class="govuk-body">
Works should and will continue regardless of the service availability. If the outage will be short you can wait for the service to come back online, otherwise you can manually record your actions using the forms provided below and send them directly to the responsible parties.
