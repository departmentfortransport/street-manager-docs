{: .govuk-heading-l #introduction}

This is the API guidance documentation for Street Manager, intended as a guide for developers integrating their systems to submit and retrieve information about street works. It is intended as a technical guide to be used with the API definition documentation and not a business change guide.

The Street Manager APIs are RESTful APIs to read/write data to the centralised Street Manager system following [GDS guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards), not a peer to peer solution.
