### 1.1. Numbers

All numbers within Street Manager system are non-negative.

### 1.2. Dates and times

Note: Street Manager receives bank holiday data from gov.uk up to the end of the following year, any works that extend beyond that will not be factoring in bank holidays.

#### 1.2.1. Date and time format

All dates and times must match the ISO 8601 standard date format.

See GOV.UK guidance for date-times <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard>

#### 1.2.2. Calendar days

Street Manager calculates calendar days based on a 24 hour clock.

For example, the Street Manager system would consider the time period Monday 01:00 to Tuesday 23:00 as 2 calendar days.

#### 1.2.3. Calendar month

Street Manager calculates a calendar month as 28 calendar days for the purpose of deeming and early start.

### 1.3. Coordinates

Coordinates must be a GeoJSON geometry (using British National Grid, easting and northing pairs).

### 1.4. Unique Street Reference Number (USRN)

<!-- ==================================================== -->

## 2. Workstreams

<!-- ==================================================== -->

The Street Manager system will, by default, create a workstream with the prefix of ‘000’ for every organisation. Before users start raising works in Street Manager (production), their organisation **must** set up their workstreams as PAA/PAs cannot be raised using the '000' workstream.

When organisations set up their workstreams, they can choose to allocate numerical prefixes between 1 - 999.
See works reference number (WRN) section for details on how the workstream prefix will be used when raising works.

_(Previously section 15 & 15.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible" />

<!-- ==================================================== -->

## 3. Works submissions and applications

<!-- ==================================================== -->

### 3.1. Works reference number (WRN)

* The WRN is generated in the following format: {SWA prefix} {workstream prefix} {promoter works reference}
  * **SWA prefix** - Two characters of the related organisation from the SWA code list.
  * **Workstream prefix** - A minimum of three numbers with leading zeros where applicable e.g. '001'. See the workstream section for more details.
  * **Promoter works reference** - Between 1 to 19 characters. May be generated by the Street Manager system or provided by the user. If generated by Street Manager, the promoter works reference will consist of a randomly generated 8-digit number (following the unique WRN rule).
* The WRN including the prefix must be unique in the Street Manager system e.g. the same organisation may have two works records with the same 'promoter works reference' if the works were created under two different workstreams.
* WRNs are not case-sensitive and displayed as uppercase.
* WRNs can only include the following special characters: dashes (-) or underscores (_) to separate characters
* Works records and WRNs are created automatically alongside other records such as forward plans and permit applications.

_(Previously section 1.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

* All forward plan details can be edited with the exception of namely the workstream, the highway authority and the USRN.
* When progressed to a PAA, the forward plan's status automatically gets set to 'Progressed'.

### 3.4. PAA and permit applications (PA)

#### 3.4.1. Permit reference number

* The permit reference number is generated in the following format: {WRN} - {numerical suffix}
  * **WRN** - See the works reference number section for more details.
  * **Numerical suffix** - A minimum of two numbers starting from 01 for the first PAA or PA created on the works record and counts up consecutively for each additional PA (i.e. -01, -02, -03 etc).

_(Previously section 1.14 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

#### 3.4.5. Adding PAA & PA

* PAs may be added resulting in a new works record or added to an existing works record.
* PAs can only be added to an existing works record if the works record does not contain a Minor/Standard/Major PA that is 'in progress' or 'submitted'.
* Major PAA must be the first application on a works record i.e. cannot be added as a second application on an existing works record.
* A major PAA may be progressed to PA if it is in 'submitted' or 'granted' status.

_(Previously section 1.12 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 

#### 3.4.6. Early start

* If a PAA/PA does not provide sufficient advance notice (based on the proposed start date provided), including when the proposed start date is altered during a change request, the promoter will be required to specify if they have pre-approval for an early start and additional information.
* The early start calculation will be carried out immediately after the proposed start and end dates have been entered during the apply for PAA/PA process.
* The early start calculation will include the day of the application is made.
* The minimum notice period by works category are as follows:

| Works category | Minimum notice period                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Major PAA      | 3 calendar months (84 calendar days in Street Manager) |

* The assessment decision options for PAA/PA are as follows:

| Assessment decision           | Applicable for                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Grant                         | All PAA/PA                       |
| Refuse                        | All PAA/PA                       |
| Modification request          | PA only (not in 'Closed' status) |
| Grant with duration challenge | Immediate PA only                |

* The assessment decision may be changed to grant or refuse on PAs that have a status of 'modification requested' and no change requests awaiting assessment.
  * Modification requested PAs will not deem as the action is with the promoter.
* Street Manager will automatically set a record's assessment decision under the following circumstances:
  * Immediate works that are started and completed before an assessment decision has been manually submitted will have the assessment decision of "Granted (auto)".
  * When a major PA is assessed, the associated PAA will take on the matching assessment decision if the an assessment decision has not been manually submitted for the PAA. e.g. if a major PA is refused, the PAA will have the assessment decision of "Refused (auto)".

| Modified permit         | Promoter      | Change initiated when PA is in status 'Modification requested'                            | No (Assess PA directly)     |
| Works extension         | Promoter      | Same criteria as 'Promoter change request' and includes a change to the proposed end date | Yes                         |
| HA imposed change       | HA            | Change initiated when PA has assessment decision as 'Granted'                             | No                          |

* For modified permit, promoter imposed and HA imposed change types, the changes made will be applied automatically to the PA with the change request record available to see what has changed historically, and these change request types are not chargeable.
  * In the case of a modified permit change request (response to modification requested by HA), this means that only the outstanding PA will need to be assessed once the changes have been applied.
* A PA's response period is not affected by promoter imposed changes (i.e. changes while the PA is awaiting assessment).
* A works extension change request may include other changes in addition to a change to the proposed end date.
* HA imposed change is currently limited to adding or removing conditions.

_(Previously section 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.8 & 26 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 

### 4.3. Adding change requests

* Each PA may have only one change request awaiting assessment. 
* A change request may be added to PAs that are not 'Refused', 'Revoked' or 'Closed'.
* The works category may be updated if the works duration is changed.
* Change requests may not be added to a PAA.
* All fields apart from the following can be changed on a PA: 
  * Permit reference number or works reference number
  * USRN
  * USRN address e.g. road/street
  * Road category
  * Primary notice authority the PA is submitted to
* Proposed start date may not be changed if works start has been logged.
* All change requests show the original details and changed values.

_(Previously section 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 & 5.6 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 

### 4.4. Change request assessment decision options

* The assessment decision options for change requests are as follows:

| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grant                         | Promoter change request & works extension | Changes will be applied to the PA.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Refuse                        | Promoter change request & works extension | Changes will not be applied to the PA. Original PA will remain unchanged in status and contents i.e. the PA is not refused as a result of a change request assessment.                                |
| Grant with duration challenge | Works extension                           | A reasonable period end date and reason for the duration challenge must be provided. The new proposed end date, reasonable period end date and any other changes requested will be applied to the PA. |

_(Previously section 5.1, 5.4, 5.5 & 25.3 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 

### 4.5. Change request response period

* The response period for change requests is 2 working days. The change request will deem after this period and the changes will be applied to the PA.

## 5. Revoking a PA

<!-- ==================================================== -->

* A PA may be revoked if the PA has been granted and before works stop has been logged.
* If a PA is revoked 
  * before works start has been logged, the PA will remain in the final status of 'Revoked' where no further actions can be performed on the PA by the promoter.
  * after works start has been logged, the promoter may request a change, log works stop and add reinstatements.
  * with a change request awaiting assessment on a PA, the change request will be revoked automatically.

  * Non-traffic sensitivity is determined either by there being no traffic-sensitive designations for the works' USRN or if there are, none were selected by the promoter as applicable to the works.
* If a works' actual start date is later than the proposed start date and within validity period, Street Manager will shift the proposed end date accordingly maintaining the same works duration as originally proposed starting from the actual start date.
* The validity periods for each works category are as follows (includes original start date unless start date is on a non-working day, in which case it's the next working day):

| Works category | Validity period        |

### 7.7. Geographical areas and views

(work in progress)

### 7.7.1. Managing geographical areas

* Only admin users can manage geographical areas
* Each geographical area is defined by a list of USRNs.
  * The list of USRNs must be provided as a csv file with one column of USRNs.
  * The maximum number of USRNs per geographical area is 10,000.

<!-- ==================================================== -->

## 8. Sites and reinstatements

<!-- ==================================================== -->

### 8.1. Sites and site numbers

* A new site will be added automatically when 'Add a reinstatement' is selected on the 'works record' level.
* For each works record, the site numbers begin at 1 and counts up consecutively for each additional site (i.e. Site 1, Site 2, Site 3 etc).
* All historical reinstatement details are available for each site on the individual 'site record' pages.

### 8.2. Reinstatement types

* The reinstatement types are as follows:
  * Excavation
  * Bar holes
  * Core holes
  * Pole testing
* Reinstatement measurements and whether the reinstatement is a final reinstatement must be provided for excavation reinstatement type.
  * Optionally, a second set of coordinates may be provided.
* Number of holes must be provided for bar holes, core holes and pole testing reinstatement types.

_(Previously section 4.7 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

### 8.3. Adding reinstatements

* To add a reinstatement, the latest PA must be in 'In progress or 'Closed' status and require excavation.
* Reinstatement date must be:
  * the current date or in the past
  * on or after the actual start date
  * on or before the actual end date if works stop has been logged
* To update a site with a new reinstatement, select 'Update reinstatement' on the 'site record' level.
* This functionality may be used to correct a mistake on the previous reinstatement.
* A reinstatement can be interim or permanent.
  * Note: if a mistake is made where the Reinstatement state 'Interim' is selected instead of 'permanent', a new PA would be required to rectify this mistake. See the business rules regarding making an interim site permanent for more information.
* Reinstatement site measurements or number of holes may be set to zero if the site has been subsumed/combined.

_(Previously section 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 & 4.6 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

### 8.4. Making interim sites permanent

* If an existing site is in 'interim' state, a new PA must be raised to add a 'permanent' reinstatement to the existing site.

_(Previously section 4.4 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

### 8.5. Reinstatement end dates

* If the reinstatement state is 'interim', the interim period end date is 6 months from the reinstatement date e.g. if an interim reinstatement date is 26/10/18 then the end date should be 25/04/19
* If the reinstatement state is 'permanent' and
  * depth is less than or equal to 1.5m, the end date (guarantee expiry date) is 2 years from the reinstatement date e.g. if reinstatement added 13/06/18, end date is 12/06/20.
  * depth is greater than 1.5m, the end date (guarantee expiry date) is 3 years from the reinstatement date e.g. if reinstatement added 13/06/18, end date is 12/06/21.

_(Previously section 4.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

### 8.6. Indicating when final site has been registered

* Final site registered may be set to 'Yes' as part of a reinstatement submission or directly on the works record level.
* Final site registered should be indicated for each PA where excavation was required.

_(Previously section 4.3 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

## 13. Fee reporting

<!-- ==================================================== -->

* A fee report is available showing individual entries for every chargeable transaction within a specified date range. Dates queried are the date of the chargeable transaction.
* The chargeable transactions included are as follows:
  * Granting of a PA
  * PAA progressed to PA - note, this occurs upon receipt of the PA, not when it is granted
  * Granting of a change request
  * A change in works category
* The maximum date range for the fee report is 31 calendar days.
* The fee report results are sorted by date of the chargeable transaction in ascending order.
* The following will be provided to support organisations calculating the fees due:
  * **Road category**
  * **Is street is traffic-sensitive** - are there any traffic-sensitive designations for the works' USRN?
  * **Is works is traffic-sensitive** - were any traffic-sensitive designations selected by the promoter on the PA?
* Note: The works category field will be populated with the PAA/PA's current works category at the time the report is run as opposed to showing the works category of the PAA/PA at the time the chargeable transaction took place.
* For example, if a PA is granted then soon after a works extension was also granted changing it from a standard to a major PA, there would be three transactions for this PA in the fee report:
  * granting of a PA
  * granting of a change request 
  * change in works category
  * The works category field for all three of these transactions will be 'major'
* Not included: inspection chargeable transactions; fee amounts
