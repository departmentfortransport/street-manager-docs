<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 2. Workstreams
<!-- ==================================================== -->

Before users start raising works in Street Manager, their organisation must set up their workstreams. These were previously known as ‘operational districts’.

The Street Manager system will, by default, create the prefix ‘000’ for every organisation. When organisations set up their workstreams, they can choose to allocate numerical prefixes between 1 - 999.
See works reference number (WRN) section for details on how the workstream prefix will be used when raising works.

_(Previously section 15 & 15.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_


<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible" />



<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 3. Works submissions and applications
<!-- ==================================================== -->

### 3.1. Works reference number (WRN)

* The WRN is generated in the following format: {SWA prefix} {workstream prefix} {promoter works reference}
  * **SWA prefix** consists of two characters for the related organisation from the SWA code list.
  * **Workstream prefix** - See the workstream section for more details
  * **Promoter works reference** - Between 1 to 19 characters generated by the Street Manager system or provided by the user.
* The WRN including the prefix must be unique in the Street Manager system e.g. the same organisation may have two works records with the same 'promoter works reference' if the works were created under two different workstreams.
* WRNs are not case-sensitive and displayed as uppercase.
* WRNs can only include the following special characters: dashes (-) or underscores (_) to separate characters
* Works records and WRNs are created automatically alongside other records such as forward plans and permit applications.

_(Previously section 1.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_  


<br />

### 3.2. Forward plans

* It is only possible to add forward plans for a start date in the present or future, and with an end date in the future.
* Forward plans can be progressed to PAA, edited or cancelled while in the ‘Raised’ status. 
* All forward plan details can be edited with the exception of certain details, namely the workstream, the highway authority and the USRN.
* When progressed to a PAA, the forward plan's status automatically gets set to 'Progressed'.

* Early start calculation will include the working day during which the application is being made.
* The minimum advance notice by works category are as follows:

| Works category | Minimum advance notice |
|:---------------|:-----------------------|

* PA's can only be added to an existing works record if the works record does not contain a Minor/Standard/Major PA that is 'in progress' or 'submitted'.
* Major PAA must be the first application on a works record i.e. cannot be added as a second application on an existing works record.
