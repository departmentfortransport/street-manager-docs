# Reporting data options in Street Manager

Street Manager offers a number of ways your organisation can retrieve data to do reporting.

## UI - List pages

Street Manager has a number of list pages designed to display key information about your organisations works. These lists have complex filtering options which allow you to request specific sets of the information for reporting purposes. The filter options are persisted in the page URL, so you can bookmark the page in your browser to save pre-defined reports and share with others.



Each list page has an option at the bottom of the screen to export your results as CSV, allowing you define your report and then export the data set.

## UI - Export CSV

## UI - Get all my data (TBC)

## API - Reporting API

## API - Data Export API

## API - Work API

If you need the lowest level of information about individual Works/Permits/Inspections/FPNs you can use the Work API. This will give you information as structured [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), full details are in the [API documentation](https://departmentfortransport.github.io/street-manager-docs/api-documentation/). To retrieve information from the API you will need an API enabled user account and an application or script to call the API.
