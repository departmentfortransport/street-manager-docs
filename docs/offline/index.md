<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Introduction</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Planned and unplanned outages can happen as part of a digital service. When this does occur, the following guidance documentation can help you continue to operate if the service is unavailable for a prolonged period.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Where to get information about outages</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  For incidents identified by the Service Team through our automated proactive monitoring, the Public Beta Manager will notify users through email.  Information will also be available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://streetmanager.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1">Street Manager support portal</a>.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  In the event of a service outage, a service maintenance page will also be displayed online.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Different types of outages</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The service may have different types of outages which could include planned or unplanned ones.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  During Public Beta between 1 November 2019 and 31 March 2020, the release and maintenance process will be a mixture of regular end-of-sprint and expedited releases. Expedited releases are changes outside the standard release process and could include, for example, an emergency release to fix an incident in line with the Service Level Agreements. The standard release and maintenance process will aim for updates to the service environments every 2 weeks. Users will be notified of planned service downtime at least 5 working days in advance as soon as an expedited release is identified.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Emergency maintenance activities, such as a security patch, may be required, and users will be notified of the this need as soon as it is identified.
</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">What to do during an outage</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Works on site must continue regardless of service availability. If the outage is short-term, you can wait for the service to come back online. Otherwise, you can manually record your actions using the forms below and send them directly to the responsible parties either via email or any other way that has been agreed.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">For external systems that integrate with the service</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://departmentfortransport.github.io/street-manager-docs/api-documentation/">API documentation</a> for details on how to recover from an outage.
