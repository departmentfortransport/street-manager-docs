    <p class="govuk-body-l">This website is run by the Department of Transport. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a rel="external" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

    <h3 id="enforcement-procedure" class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).

    <h2 id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility" class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Department for Transport is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>


    <h2 id="non-accessible-content" class="govuk-heading-l">Non accessible content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>


    <h3 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations" class="govuk-heading-m">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Aria was used on all pages of the site that did not have the correct roles. Having the incorrect markup may lead to issues for users of assistive technologies such as screen reading software.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.1 (Parsing). We plan to fix this by April 2020.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The fieldset tags have elements present within them that are not valid. This means that screen reader users may not receive the correct information.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions). We plan to fix this by April 2020.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">There were list elements found that have direct children that are not allowed inside &#x3C;li&#x3E; elements.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships). We plan to fix this by April 2020.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The calendars cannot be actioned via keyboard commands. These can only be actioned by mouse users. Some calendars did not receive focus on tab which caused confusion for our analysts.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard). We plan to fix this by April 2020.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">There were illogical heading structures found on pages. Having a logical and hierarchical heading structure will ensure that screen reader users can navigate the page by importance of content.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.10 (Section Headings). We plan to fix this by April 2020.</p>

    <h3 id="disproportionate-burden" class="govuk-heading-m">Disproportionate burden</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We do not plan on making the map screens fully usable by users with screen readers or unable to use a mouse. Instead those users should use our non-map flow to submit information via forms.</p>

    <h3 id="content-thats-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations" class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Some PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, uploaded traffic management plan PDFs and forms uploaded as Word documents.</p>
