# Glossary & Business Rules Guidelines

## Glossary

* Only define terms that have not been previously defined elsewhere such as NRSWA, GeoPlace and other legislation.
* Is the term currently used in legislation or EToN specification and not currently defined in those documents? If yes, is there a strong need for us to define the term that already exists in the industry?
* Consider adding the new terms Street Manager has adopted e.g. Change requests.
* Do not include business rules or description of functionality.

## Business rules

* Wherever possible, describe the raw business rules only and not functionality including flow diagrams of exactly what is clicked and what is presented next; where on the system they can access the functionality like the home page; and technical functionality. System functionality changes regularly and it would be difficult to keep up in this documentation.
* If functionality must be described, consider having knowledge base articles created for this instead.
* Avoid having rules that describe permission access only e.g. promoter user can do x. Better to be added to a permission and roles table (to be produced separately) which can be managed much more easily.
* Consider defining terms in the glossary rather than in business rules.
* Avoid narrative around why a rule or functionality is the way that it is

## Permissions and roles table

* Coming soon.
