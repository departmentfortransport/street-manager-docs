<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h1>

<p class="govuk-body-l">
  This page contains guidance for developers integrating their systems with the Street Manager API so they can submit and retrieve information about street works.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  The page is split into two sections. The first contains specification documentation which describes the legally required API functions and interfaces which are due to be delivered in the coming weeks and months.  The second section lists the versioned and dated releases, as the specified functionality is implemented and deployed into the service environments.

<p class="govuk-body-m">
This is the V2 baseline specification which describes all legally required API functions and interfaces. There are no breaking changes planned to be introduced in upcoming releases; while new functionality may be introduced in future versions of the V2 specification, these changes will be purely additive in nature to prevent existing integrations from breaking.
