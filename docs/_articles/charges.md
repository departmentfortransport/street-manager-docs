## Street Manager Charges
{: .govuk-heading-m}

How are Street Manager funds used?
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The DfT has invested over £10m in the development of Street Manager. The service is now funded through user charges. These charges are used to fund the costs involved in maintaining the service and for its continuous improvement.
{: .govuk-body}
The charges are fixed for the first 2 years of operation. In mid-2021, we will have a full year of Street Manager data and can discuss both changes to the methodology of calculating the charges and if we want to reduce or increase the speed of development of Street Manager functionality.
To be clear, charges for Street Manager will be used to fund the maintenance and continuous improvement of the service. They are on a cost recovery basis. Any surplus that may arise will be used to improve Street Manager.
Charges are by organisation (local highway authority and statutory undertaker). There are no restrictions on the number of users, once your organisation has signed up. Any future development and new services will be made available to all users at no additional cost, and each organisation will be charged whether you use Street Manager via the user interface or via an API.

How are charges calculated?
{: .govuk-heading-s}

These figures have been calculated based on a three-year average of works carried out between 1st Jan 2016 and 31st Dec 2018. We have decided to place organisations in bands rather than basing charges on individual transactions, in part because the level of detailed data is not yet available to the DfT. Once we have actual Street Manager data, it may be that we do change the basis of calculation to individual transactions, but that will be for discussion at the appropriate time.
{: .govuk-body}
We want the charges to be fair, so that larger organisations/heavy users pay more than smaller ones/light users. We have decided to charge Highway Authorities and Works Promoters for 50% of the costs of Street Manager each and use two different methodologies for calculating the costs for the two parties. These methodologies have been discussed with Streetworks UK and JAG(UK).
{: .govuk-body}

Those methods are as follow:<br>
{: .govuk-heading-s}

Works Promoters – Calculated based on number of works undertaken by the promoter in the relevant time period.
Highway Authorities – Calculated based on number of works carried out in that Authority in the relevant time period, excluding the Authority’s own works.
