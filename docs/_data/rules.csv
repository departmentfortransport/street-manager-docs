If generating WRN automatically, full WRN including an 8 digit number unique to each workstream in the same organisation within the Street Manager system - the 8 digits in the WRN will need to be unique as this will be the distinguishing part, but these 8 digits can be the same for two permits if the workstream is different for each.

Works reference number with a numerical suffix (-01, -02, -03 etc) which counts up from 1 dependent on the number of permits which have already been raised.
{SWA_prefix} {workstream_prefix} - {Promoter works reference} - {StreetManager record suffix}

12,1.10,,PA Deeming,"The deadline / response date are the same. This is the date by which the HA needs to respond to the submission of the permit application by in order to avoid the permit deeming. 

The response periods for permit applications before deeming are as follows‌:

- PAA - 28 calendar days (clock starts ticking on following working day to submission as per other deeming logic for all other permits)

- Major - 5 working days 

- Standard - 5 working days 

- Minor - 2 working days

- Immediate - 2 working days 

EToN specification states: ""The response period does not include the day on which the notification was given."" so anything submitted after 4:30pm, is effectively the same as submitting them the next working day; the working day calculation is 00:00 - 16:30 each day.

Example scenario:
If a PAA is submitted on Tuesday at 2:00pm it’ll deem in 28 calendar days, with the count starting from the next day (Wednesday), so Wednesday  is day 1, so Wednesday + 27 calendar days would be your deadline date
If this PAA was to be submitted after 4:30pm on the same Tuesday, this effectively acts as through the PAA was submitted the next day, which means the response period is actually two days away, so same scenario different time:

1. Permit submitted Tuesday 4:31pm
2. Response period (we start counting from) Thursday
3. Thursday is day 1 + 27 calendar days
