<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 2. Workstreams
<!-- ==================================================== -->

The Street Manager system will, by default, create a workstream with the prefix of ‘000’ for every organisation. Before users start raising works in Street Manager (production), their organisation **must** set up their workstreams.

When organisations set up their workstreams, they can choose to allocate numerical prefixes between 1 - 999.
See works reference number (WRN) section for details on how the workstream prefix will be used when raising works.

_(Previously section 15 & 15.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_


<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible" />



<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 3. Works submissions and applications
<!-- ==================================================== -->

### 3.1. Works reference number (WRN)

* The WRN is generated in the following format: {SWA prefix} {workstream prefix} {promoter works reference}
  * **SWA prefix** - Two characters of the related organisation from the SWA code list.
  * **Workstream prefix** - A minimum of three numbers with leading zeros where applicable e.g. '001'. See the workstream section for more details.
  * **Promoter works reference** - Between 1 to 19 characters generated by the Street Manager system or provided by the user. If generated by Street Manager, the promoter works reference will consist of a randomly generated 8-digit number (following the unique WRN rule).
* The WRN including the prefix must be unique in the Street Manager system e.g. the same organisation may have two works records with the same 'promoter works reference' if the works were created under two different workstreams.
* WRNs are not case-sensitive and displayed as uppercase.
* WRNs can only include the following special characters: dashes (-) or underscores (_) to separate characters
* Works records and WRNs are created automatically alongside other records such as forward plans and permit applications.

_(Previously section 1.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_

<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 4. Change requests (CR)
<!-- ==================================================== -->

### 4.1. Change request reference number

* The change request reference number is generated in the following format: {permit reference number} -CR- {numerical suffix}
    * See the **permit reference number** section for more details.
    * Numerical suffix - A minimum of two numbers starting from 01 for the first change request created on the PA and counts up consecutively for each additional change request (i.e. -01, -02, -03 etc).

### 4.2. Change request types

* The change request types are as follows:

| Change request type | Available for | Criteria | Assessment required? |
|:--------------------|:---------------------|:---------|:------------------------|
| Promoter imposed change (modified application) | Promoter | PA is awaiting assessment | No |
| Promoter change request | Promoter |  PA in status 'Granted', 'In progress' or 'Modification Requested' | Yes |
| Works extension | Promoter | Same criteria as 'Promoter change request' and includes a change to the proposed end date | Yes |
| HA imposed change | HA | PA in status 'Granted' or 'In progress' | No |

* For promoter imposed and HA imposed change types, the changes made will be applied automatically to the PA with the change request record available to see what has changed historically, and these change request types are not chargeable.
* A PA's response period is not affected by promoter imposed changes (i.e. changes while the PA is awaiting assessment).
* A works extension change request may include other changes in addition to a change to the proposed end date.
* HA imposed change is currently limited to adding or removing conditions.
* Promoter change requests include the change requests submitted as a response to a 'modification request' assessment decision.

_(Previously section 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.8 & 26 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 




### 4.3. Adding change requests

* Each PA may have only one change request awaiting assessment. 
* A change request may be added to PAs that are not 'Refused', 'Revoked' or 'Closed'
* The works category may be updated if the works duration is changed.
* Change requests may not be added to a PAA.
* The following cannot be changed on a PA: 
    * Permit reference number or works reference number
    * USRN
    * USRN address e.g. road/street
    * Road category
    * Primary notice authority the PA is submitted to
* Proposed start date may not be changed if works start has been logged.
* All change requests show the original details and changed values.

_(Previously section 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 & 5.6 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 





### 4.4. Change request assessment decision options

* The assessment decision options for change requests are as follows:

| Assessment decision | Applicable for CR type | Assessment decision impact |
|:------------------|:--------------------|:---|
| Grant | Promoter change request & works extension | Changes will be applied to the PA. |
| Refuse | Promoter change request & works extension | Changes will not be applied to the PA. Original PA will remain unchanged in status and contents i.e. the PA is not refused as a result of a change request assessment. | 
| Grant with duration challenge | Works extension | HA to provide a reasonable period end date and reason for the duration challenge. The new proposed end date, reasonable period end date and any other changes requested will be applied to the PA. |

* Note: Currently, granting or refusing a change request created as a response to 'modification request' will not grant or refuse the the related PA or affect it in any way. The PA will need to be assessed separately (changes to this are coming soon).


_(Previously section 5.1, 5.4, 5.5 & 25.3 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 



### 4.5. Change request response period

* The response period for change requests is 2 working days. The change request will deem after this period and the changes will be applied to the PA.

_(Previously section 5.7 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 




### 4.6. Cancelling change requests

* Promoters may only cancel change requests for PAs that they have full-access permissions to.


### 4.7. Change request statuses

<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 5. Revoking a PA
<!-- ==================================================== -->

* HA may revoke a PA that has been granted and before works stop has been logged.
* If a PA is revoked 
    * before works start has been logged, the PA will remain in the final status of 'Revoked' where no further actions can be performed on the PA by the promoter.
    * after works start has been logged, the promoter may request a change, log works stop and add reinstatements.
    * with a change request awaiting assessment on a PA, the change request be revoked automatically.

* The fee report results are sorted by date of the chargeable transaction in ascending order.

* The following will be provided to support organisations calculating the fees due:
    * **Road category**
    * **Is street is traffic-sensitive** - are there any traffic-sensitive designations for the works' USRN?
    * **Is works is traffic-sensitive** - were any traffic-sensitive designations selected by the promoter on the PA?

* For example, if a PA is granted then soon after a works extension was also granted changing it from a standard to a major PA, there would be three transactions for this PA in the fee report:
    * granting of a PA
    * granting of a change request 
    * change in works category
    * The works category field for all three of these transactions will be 'major'
