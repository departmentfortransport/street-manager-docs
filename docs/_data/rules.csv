****Note - currently the working day duration factors in bank holidays. However, we are only receiving bank holidays into our system from gov.uk up to the end of the next year (so if 2019, end of 2020.

- Standard - 5 working days

- Minor - 2 working days

- Immediate - 2 working days

EToN specification states: ""The response period does not include the day on which the notification was given."" so anything submitted after 4:30pm, is effectively the same as submitting them the next working day; the working day calculation is 00:00 - 16:30 each day.","https://streetmanager.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BETA/pages/810910144/Permit+Logic+-+Response+Times+PAA+PA

- Minor - 3 days

If the proposed start date is less than the notice period date promoter will be required to specify if they have pre-approval for the early start.

10,1.10,Permit fields,PA Deeming,"The deadline / response date are the same. This is the date by which the HA needs to respond to the submission of the permit application by in order to avoid the permit deeming.

The response periods for permit applications before deeming are as follows‌:

- PAA - 28 calendar days (clock starts ticking on following working day to submission as per other deeming logic for all other permits)

- Major - 5 working days

- Standard - 5 working days

- Minor - 2 working days

- Immediate - 2 working days

EToN specification states: ""The response period does not include the day on which the notification was given."" so anything submitted after 4:30pm, is effectively the same as submitting them the next working day; the working day calculation is 00:00 - 16:30 each day.

Example scenario:
If a PAA is submitted on Tuesday at 2:00pm it’ll deem in 28 calendar days, with the count starting from the next day (Wednesday), so Wednesday  is day 1, so Wednesday + 27 calendar days would be your deadline date
If this PAA was to be submitted after 4:30pm on the same Tuesday, this effectively acts as through the PAA was submitted the next day, which means the response period is actually two days away, so same scenario different time:

1. Permit submitted Tuesday 4:31pm
2. Response period (we start counting from) Thursday
3. Thursday is day 1 + 27 calendar days
