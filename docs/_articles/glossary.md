<p>Additional Street Data</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Additional Street Data (&ldquo;ASD&rdquo;) refers to&nbsp;extra information about a street that may affect works. This&nbsp;is part of the National Street Gazetteer (NSG) database,&nbsp;and&nbsp;includes things such as road centre lines, ownership details, level of reinstatement required, height, weight and width restrictions and direction of travel. This includes designations which identifies highly trafficked highways so that promoters know they must give greater advanced warning of proposed works or activities. Depending on circumstances, a designation may apply to the carriageway only, to a footway or pedestrian area only, or to any part of a length of street. Designations may only apply to certain times of day, days of the week, or days of the year.</p>

<p>This is the time period that a Highway Authority (HA) has to assess and evaluate a permit application (or any other promoter request) prior to the permit deeming. The HA has the options to &lsquo;Grant&rsquo;, &lsquo;Grant with Changes&rsquo; or &lsquo;Refuse&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Immediate works are split into two subcategories (Immediate emergency, or Immediate urgent) that define the urgency with which they need to be carried out, so the term 'Immediate' is also used at the next level down in the hierarchy of meaning.

<p>'Street works' are those carried out by statutory undertakers (utility companies, etc) to provide and maintain utility assets (like gas mains, etc).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The area that the works will occupy on the highway, this may include all signing, lighting and guarding and may include diversionary routes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Works category</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Works category is the umbrella term used to define roadworks according to length&nbsp;of time they take to be carried out, or the urgency with which they need to be carried out.</p>
<p>The terms that sit within this are:</p>
<p>Minor, Standard, Major or Major (PAA &ndash; Provisional Advance Authorisation), or Immediate. See relevant entries for definition of sub-groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, each works category has a required notice period, and predefined response time in which the highway authority is required to respond.</p>

<p>Works record</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Works record gathers and contains all information for a roadwork in one place. This is a new concept in Street Manager that combines permits, Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs), inspections, comments, and registering reinstatements &ndash; as well as on site activities such as work start/stop, registrations.</p>

<p>Works reference number (WRN)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A unique reference number (limited to 24 characters) issued to any work raised by a promoter. Note, this links to the works record &ndash; and is not the same as the permit reference number which promoters need to display on site. The beginning of the WRN is made up of a 2-letter promoter prefix, followed by 3 numbers which identify the workstream.</p>

<p>Works status</p>

<p>This reflects the status of the actual activities happening on site. Note, the works status only appears on the works record, and is different to&nbsp;the permit status (which reflects actions regarding the permission to work). The different statuses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planned &ndash; this is the status of a works prior to the permit being authorised (granted or deemed) and where works have been granted but not yet started</li>
<li>In progress &ndash; this is the status of the works post authorisation of the permit but prior to the works being completed. Indicates the works are underway</li>
<li>Completed &ndash; the status once the works have been physically completed on site and a works stop notification logged by the promoter</li>
<li>Cancelled &ndash; where a works has been put into the planned status but the works have not been started and the application has been withdrawn by the promoter prior to authorisation to commence (grant).</li>

<p>Works type</p>
</td>

<p>Roadworks being carried out fall into two broad categories, with several (sub-)categories that sit beneath them. 'Works type' is the top-level distinction, used to distinguish roadworks according to whether they are:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;<strong>Planned </strong>(scheduled in advance)</p>
<p>b) <strong>Immediate&nbsp;</strong>(unexpected and critical)</p>

<p>Workstream&nbsp;</p>
</td>

<p>Previously called organisational districts, these were used to sub-divide an organisation (both promoter and HA) into departments. Sometimes organisations carve up departments geographically, while other times by type of works (e.g. clean water, waste water and so on).&nbsp;</p>
