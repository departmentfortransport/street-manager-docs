<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Note that this documentation is being trialled for use with the Street Manager Beta and is aimed towards authorised Beta participants. <b>As Street Manager remains under active development, this documentation will continue to develop over time.</b>

<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h1>

<p class="govuk-body-l">
  This page contains guidance for developers integrating their systems with the Street Manager API so they can submit and retrieve information about street works.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  The page is split into two sections. The first contains specification documentation which describes the legally required API functions and interfaces which are due to be delivered in the coming weeks and months.  The second section lists the versioned and dated releases, as the specified functionality is implemented and deployed into the service environments.
