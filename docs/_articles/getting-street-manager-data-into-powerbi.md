This is a basic guide for how to import Street Manager data into [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) for reporting purposes. This is based on the online version of PowerBI and last updated on 28/01/2020, so there may be differences if you are using the desktop client or an updated version.

## Export CSV via UI and upload

The simplest way to get data into PowerBI is to manually export the data using the   CSV export links available on the Dashboard list pages and upload them into PowerBI for processing.

1. Log into Street Manager and go to the list page with the data you are interested in and set the filter criteria, e.g. Permits completed within a specific month.

2. Click the "Export results" link at the bottom of the list to download a CSV file with the data.
