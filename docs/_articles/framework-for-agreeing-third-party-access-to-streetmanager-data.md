## **Framework for agreeing third party access to Street Manager data**

The Street Manager service enables users to create or process their street and roadworks through a central service provided by the Department for Transport (DfT).

Some authorised Street Manager users (local authorities and utility companies) want to give access to Street Manager data to third-party integrators. These integrators will take that user’s data, process it through another product and will then provide or serve the data back to that user.

The aim of this framework is to outline the controls that the DfT expects authorised Street Manager users to either already have or to put in place with any of the third-party integrators who they want to give access to Street Manager for the purpose of providing services to them. This framework is aimed at ensuring compliance with both the UK’s GDPR laws and Street Manager’s own terms and conditions to which all authorised users will have agreed when they signed up to use the service.

It should be noted that granting access to Street Manager data means those integrators can access a range of other users’ data, including personal information. Authorised users may also therefore want to check with their own GDPR teams for further advice if needed.

Any third party that wants to access Street Manager data and use it for any other purpose must take data from the open data stream that can be accessed here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-and-use-roadworks-data

Terms of access to Street Manager data for the purpose of providing services or products to the authorised Street Manager that is granting access

• The third-party integrator should only perform actions within Street Manager when explicitly requested by the authorised user and the result of that action should be relayed only to the requesting authorised user.

• Third party integrators access is to be via an authorised user’s account only, and the third-party is classified as a data processor (or otherwise disallowed autonomy with the data) via a contractual arrangement.

• Third parties should ensure that all other uses of Street Manager data will be via the open data API service. Examples of other uses include:

o Using Street Manager data for public facing apps or web services

o Using Street Manager data for roadworks planning services that requires its own registration

o Using Street Manager data for journey planning services

o Taking data about one area or promoter and passing that data to another area or promoter

o Using Street Manager data for research or statistical analysis purposes (other than that requested by an authorised user and presented back to them).

If an authorised user wants to access Street Manager via a third party for the works or reporting APIs, the authorised user needs to ensure that the following steps are taken with the third party:

• An agreement must be in place with the third-party that states that they are a data processor, and the authorised user is a data controller. Failing this, a contract must be in place that prevents the third-party using the data they retrieve for any other purpose than serving the authorised user.

• Users need to ensure that they are not requesting the third-party to undertake any action that would result in a breach of the Street Manager’s terms and conditions. The user account responsible may be deactivated if non-compliant activity is detected.

• Data taken from Street Manager is not used for any unlawful purposes by either party.

• Authorised users need to ensure that third parties are not taking their data from Street Manager and sharing with other organisations (other than what is already shared with all users of the Street Manager service). For example, the promoter needs to ensure that the third-party is not exposing their works record to other promoters using the third-party service.

• Authorised users must ensure that personal data is not entered into free text fields and that third parties are not publishing any personal data wider than other authorised Street Manager users.

The third party needs to ensure that they do not

• Profit commercially from the authorised user’s data regardless of processing undertaken, unless the data has come from the open data API (they are obviously allowed to charge an authorised user for the services being provided to them).

• Use Street Manager data in any other way than is requested by the authorised user.

• Use Street Manager data on public facing websites or apps, either their own or after passing onto another third party, unless the data has come from the open data API.

• Use Street Manager data on any independently ringfenced websites or apps, either their own or after passing onto another third party, unless the data has come from the open data API.

• Take one authorised user organisation data and relay it to a separate authorised user. Authorised users will be able to see a portion of each other’s data under Street Manager’s business rules, and any attempt to perform additional sharing would breach the service’s Terms and Conditions.
