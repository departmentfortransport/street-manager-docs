# Glossary & Business Rules Guidelines

* DON'T USE 'Rich Text' as you get much more control and flexibility with Markdown ([Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))

## Glossary

* Only define terms that have not been previously defined elsewhere such as NRSWA, GeoPlace and other legislation.
* Is the term currently used in legislation or EToN specification and not currently defined in those documents? If yes, is there a strong need for us to define the term that already exists in the industry?
* Include all new terms Street Manager has constructed e.g. Change requests.
* Do not include business rules or description of functionality.

## Business rules

* Wherever possible, describe the raw business rules only and not functionality as system functionality changes regularly and it would be difficult to keep up in this documentation. This includes avoiding:
    * what is clicked and what is presented to the user next; 
    * where on the system they can access the functionality like the home page; and 
    * technical functionality. 
* If functionality must be described, consider having training guides/knowledge base articles created for this instead.
* Avoid having rules that describe permission access only e.g. promoter user can do x. Better to be added to a permission and roles table (to be produced separately) which can be managed much more easily.
* Consider defining terms in the glossary rather than in business rules.
* Avoid narrative around why a rule or functionality is the way that it is and what it is for. Guides/knowledge base articles may be a better place for this.
Consistent use of terms. Permit applications only appear at the beginning of the document - later these are always referred to as PA. Always include PAA with PA if applicable as PA does not include PAA.
* Where a new record type is introduced, always begin with the breakdown of what the record reference consists of using the existing template.

## Permissions and roles table

* Coming soon.
